Nest.js tutorial by Dave Gray

# 1. Intro

NestJS is a framework **built on top of Node.js**, providing a **structured** and **opinionated** approach
to building **server-side** applications.  

Nest follows the **MVC** (model-view-controller) design pattern while Express doesn't.  
In programming, MVC is an architectural design pattern that organizes an application's logic into distinct layers.  

NestJS's rapide rise in popularity can be attributed to its opinionated, **well-structured** architecture, **TypeScript**
support, **scalability**, and a strong community.  

Choosing NestJS over plain Node.js offers advantages in terms of **maintainability**, type safety, productivity, 
and integration options.  

Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust **HTTP server** frameworks like **Express** (the default).
